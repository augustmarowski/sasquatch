Clicking on the three lines &nbsp; ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwalkr/sasquatch/master/meta/burger.png) &nbsp; on the left side of the box will allow you to reorder links by dragging and droppping.

## Site Config

Clicking on **Site Config** will give you access to the site configuration options. 

When you're ready to make your website live on the internet, you will want to update the value of **Base URL**. Until then, feel free to remove the existing value and leave it blank.

## Making Your Page Live

**The preview of your page in Forestry is not permanent. Do not share this URL!** To create a permanent URL for your landing page, you will need to set up hosting.

This project is pre-configured for easy setup with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Sign up with them and import this project with the default settings.

**Remember to change or remove the value of `baseURL` in your Site Config.** If the page deployed by Netlify doesn't look right, you probably forgot to do this.
